### What is Krisp?

Krisp is a Node framework that allows you to turn your markdown files into a website. It's built to be simple to use and flexible enough to be used for any type of website.

### Own your content

There is no database or CMS to manage. You own your content and can easily edit it in your favorite text editor.

### Usage

Install Krisp from npm:

```bash
npm install krisp
```

Put your markdown files in a folder called `content` in the root of your project. Then create a file called `manifest.json` in the root of your project and add the following code:

```json
{
  "name": "My Website",
  "email": "youremail@example.com",
  "theme": "tom-preston" // That's the theme that ships with Krisp
}
```

And that's it! You can now run `krisp start` to start your website.

### Themes

Krisp ships with a default theme called `tom-preston`. It's a simple theme that's taken from [Tom Preston-Werner's website](https://tom.preston-werner.com/). That's because Tom's website was the inspiration for minimalist style of Krisp.
